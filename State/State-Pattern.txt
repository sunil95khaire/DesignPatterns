State Design Pattern falls under Behavioral Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net.

What is State Design Pattern?
This pattern is used when there is one to many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, 
its dependent objects are to be notified automatically.This pattern is used to alter the behavior of an object when it’s internal state changes. 
In this pattern, an object is created which represent various states and a context object whose behavior varies as it's state object changes.

This pattern seems as a dynamic version of the Strategy pattern.
