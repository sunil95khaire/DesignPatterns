Composite pattern falls under Structural Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net. 
Composite Pattern is used to arrange structured hierarchies. In this article, I would like share what is composite pattern and how is it work?

What is Composite Pattern?
Composite pattern is used to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be modified independently.

Composite pattern is used when we need to treat a group of objects and a single object in the same way. 
Composite pattern composes objects in term of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchies.

This pattern creates a class contains group of its own objects. This class provides ways to modify its group of same objects.

Who is what?
The classes, interfaces and objects in the above class diagram can be identified as follows:

IEmployed - Component Interface.
Employee- Composite Class.
Contractor- Leaf Class.

When to use it?
Hierarchical representations of objects are required.
A single object and a group of objects should be treated in the same way.
The Composite pattern is used when data is organized in a tree structure (for example directories in a computer).
