Proxy pattern falls under Structural Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net. 
The proxy design pattern is used to provide a surrogate object, which references to other object. 
In this article, I would like share what is proxy pattern and how is it work?

What is Proxy Pattern
The proxy design pattern is used to provide a surrogate object, which references to other object.

Proxy pattern involves a class, called proxy class, which represents functionality of another class.

There are various kinds of proxies, some of them are as follows:

Virtual proxies : Hand over the creation of an object to another object
Authentication proxies : Checks the access permissions for a request
Remote proxies : Encodes requests and send them across a network
Smart proxies : Change requests before sending them across a network

When to use it?
Objects need to be created on demand means when their operations are requested.
Access control for the original object is required.
Allow to access a remote object by using a local object(it will refer to a remote object).
