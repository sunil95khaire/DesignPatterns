Bridge pattern falls under Structural Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net. 
All we know, Inheritance is a way to specify different implementations of an abstraction. 
But in this way, implementations are tightly bound to the abstraction and can not be modified independently. 
The Bridge pattern provides an alternative to inheritance when there are more than one version of an abstraction. 
In this article, I would like share what is bridge pattern and how is it work?

What is Bridge Pattern
Bridge pattern is used to separate an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be modified independently.

This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge between the abstraction class and implementer classes 
and also makes the functionality of implementer class independent from the abstraction class. 
Both types of classes can be modified without affecting to each other.

Who is what?
The classes, interfaces and objects in the above class diagram can be identified as follows:

Message - Abstraction Class.
SystemMessage & UserMessage- Redefined Abstraction Classes.
IMessageSender- Bridge Interface.
EmailSender, WebServiceSender & MSMQ Sender- ConcreteImplementation class which implements the IMessageSender interface.

When to use it?
Abstractions and implementations should be modified independently.

Changes in the implementation of an abstraction should have no impact on clients.

The Bridge pattern is used when a new version of a software or system is brought out, 
but the older version of the software still running for its existing client. 
There is no need to change the client code, but the client need to choose which version he wants to use.

Note
Bridge pattern has nearly the same structure as the Adapter Pattern. 
But it is used when designing new systems instead of the Adapter pattern which is used with already existing systems.
