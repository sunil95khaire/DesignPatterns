Template Method Design Pattern falls under Behavioral Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net. 

What is Template Method Design pattern?
This pattern is used to define the basic steps of an algorithm and allow the implementation of the individual steps to be changed. 
This pattern looks similar to the strategy design pattern. 
The main difference is the ability to change the parts of an algorithm rather than replacing an entire algorithm.

In Template pattern, an abstract class defined the template method and this method includes the steps which are implemented by the subclasses.

When to use it?
An abstract view of an algorithm is required, but implementation varies according to the subclasses.
Common behaviors of subclasses can be used to make to a common class.
