Prototype pattern falls under Creational Pattern of Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns in .Net. 
It is used to used to create a duplicate object or clone of the current object. 
It provides an interface for creating parts of a product. In this article, I would like share what is Prototype pattern and how is it work?

What is Prototype Pattern?
Prototype pattern is used to create a duplicate object or clone of the current object to enhance performance. 
This pattern is used when creation of object is costly or complex.

For Example: An object is to be created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, 
returns its clone on next request and update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.

Who is what?
The classes, interfaces and objects in the above class diagram can be identified as follows:

IEmployee - Prototype interface
Developer & Typist- Concrete Prototype

When to use it?
The creation of each object is costly or complex.
A limited number of state combinations exist in an object.
